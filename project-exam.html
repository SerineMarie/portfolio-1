            <p>
              - I changed the title on all of the pages to represent the current
              page. I did already had it placed in through their `.js` specific
              files.
            </p>
            <p>
              - I changed the images on the `allpost.html` page, after feedback
              that they were different sizes. I had decided that the images was
              going to be different sizes to make some difference on the page,
              but beacuse of feedback, I just changed the images.
            </p>
            <p>
              - The formatting on the posts publishing date and time were hard
              to understand, I was given feedback to use the `date()` method,
              but beacuse I don't know how to use it, I hardcoded it instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              - I changed the code in `latest-posts.js` to a `for loop`, to
              remove the repition I already had.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Beacuse of the change to `latest-posts.js`, I had to create a
              new carousel to make it work. I also moved the arrows and placed
              them in a better location under the carousel.
            </p>
            <p>- I added meta description, beacuse it was missing.</p>
            <p>
              - On the `allposts.js` I had used to many `h1` elements, so I
              removed them and put the elements in a `p` tag instead. And styled
              them the same as prior to the change.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Because of WCAG guidelines, I decided to change the main color
              of the page to a dark purple instead of a light orange, to give
              the text more contrast.
            </p>
            <p>
              - I got feedback on the exam that I shouldn't use big selectors
              like I did while styling my images (styling used in `carousel.css`
              and `allposts.css`). I tried to style my images using other
              methods, but I was not able to. Not sure what was done wrong, but
              the way I did it, was the only way I was able to style spesific
              images.
            </p>
            <p>
              - After many many failed attempts, I was unfortunately not able to
              create the image modal. Even after trying out a codepen link that
              was given to me, and also by the help of other students, I was not
              able to complete that part of the assignemnt.
