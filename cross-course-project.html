            <p>
              - Made a size change to the header, so it wound't take up to much
              space on the page. To do that I only changed the size of the logo
              to make the entire header smaller.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Corrected the `title` of each page to represent the correct
              page.
            </p>
            <p>
              - I removed content from `h1` and `h2` elements, and added the
              content to a `div` tag instead and styled it afterwords to the
              same design as before.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Previously I didn't have a responsive website. So create a media
              query to make sure that the website would work on both small and
              large screens.
            </p>
            <p>
              - To get a better overview of the styling and had, I created more
              `.css` files, so I would be easier to style different elements
              from different HTML files.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Because I hadn't created a validation form to the different
              forms I had on this website I did that. And made sure it worked as
              it should. I was only able to make the form show validation if the
              inputs didn't meet the criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Before finishing I read through the feedback I got, to make sure
              I corrected everything that needed to be corrected.
