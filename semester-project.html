              - I updated my contact form to give validation if the inputs
              didn't meet the criteria I had set for it. I was not able to
              create an acceptance validation.
            </p>
            <p>
              - I read through the styling files and made sure every item had
              the right `font-family`. As it previously didn't.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Changed some of the classes and ID of elements, because I found
              out they were unnecessary. And made sure that all the styling was
              used by `class` and not `id`.
            </p>
            <p>
              - I made some changes to the navigation bar, by moving the
              `searchbar` out of the `nav` element, but still in the same `div`
              as the rest of the navigation. By doing that I had to make some
              changes to the layout of the navigation, to make it look the way I
              wanted. So I ended up moving the navigation to the left side of
              the page instead of the right.
            </p>
            <p>
              - To make the site better when on mobile or smaller screens, I
              changed the way I had styled the some of the different elements on
              every page. I did that by changeing how I made the elements in
              HTML and by selecting them by their class instead of ID.
            </p>
            <p>
              - I created different `.css` files in this project to, so that I
              could get a better overview of where I had styled the different
              elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Before finishing, I read through the feedback I got on this
              project to make sure I corrected everything that needed to be
              fixed.
